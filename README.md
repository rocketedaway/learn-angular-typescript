# Angular + TypeScript

Project for learning Angular and TypeScript.

Following along with the official [Angular 1.x tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial)

## TODO

1. Look into how to write tests for angular apps
2. Look into [controlerAs](https://toddmotto.com/digging-into-angulars-controller-as-syntax/) syntax
3. Deep dive into [Components](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/component)
